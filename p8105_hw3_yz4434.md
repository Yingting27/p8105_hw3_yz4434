# Question 2

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

## Data cleaning

``` r
brfss = brfss_smart2010 |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") |> 
  filter(response %in% c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor")) |>
  mutate(
    response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent"))
  ) |> rename(state = locationabbr) |> rename(county = locationdesc)
```

# In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about in 2010?

``` r
brfss_2002 = brfss |> 
  filter(year =="2002") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarise(n_obs = n_distinct(county)) |> 
  filter(n_obs >= 7)

brfss_2010 = brfss |> 
  filter(year =="2010") |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarise(n_obs = n_distinct(county)) |> 
  filter(n_obs >= 7)
```

In 2002, \*\*\*\* were observed at 7 or more locations. In 2010,
\*\*\*\* were observed at 7 or more locations.

# Construct a dataset

``` r
brfss_conduct = brfss |> 
  filter(response =="Excellent") |> 
  group_by(year,state) |> 
  summarise(
    mean_value = mean(data_value,na.rm = TRUE),.groups = "drop") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_value, color = state))+ geom_line()
```

# Make a two-panel plot showing

``` r
brfss_panel= brfss |> 
  filter(year %in% c("2006", "2010")) |> 
  filter(state == "NY") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y = data_value)) + geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(.~ year)
```

## Question 3

# Load, tidy, merge, and otherwise organize the data sets

- accel data sets

``` r
nhanes_accel = 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv", col_types = 
      cols(
        `SEQN` = col_character() 
)) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minutes",
    values_to = "mims"
  ) |> 
    mutate(minutes = as.numeric(str_sub(minutes, 4, -1)))
```

- covar data sets

``` r
nhanes_covar = 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4, col_types = 
      cols(
        `SEQN` = col_character()
      )) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(age >= 21) |> 
  drop_na(bmi) |>
  drop_na(education) |> 
      mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      2 ~ "female")
    )|> 
      mutate(
    education = case_match(
      education,
      1 ~ "Less than high school",
      2 ~ "High school equivalent",
      3 ~ "More than high school")) |> 
  mutate(education = forcats::fct_relevel(education, c("Less than high school","High school equivalent","More than high school")))
```

- Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in
  each education category, and create a visualization of the age
  distributions for men and women in each education category. Comment on
  these items.

``` r
sex_edu = nhanes_covar |>  
  count(education,sex) |> 
    pivot_wider(
    names_from =sex,
    values_from= n
)
knitr::kable
```

``` r
vis_age = nhanes_covar|>
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = age, color = sex ))+geom_boxplot()+ facet_grid(.~ education)
```

According to the output, we can see that in the level of high school
equivalent, there are 23 female and 35 male;in the level of less than
high school, there are 28 female 27 male; in the level of more than high
school, there are 59 female and 56 male. Based on the distribution of
age

- merge datasets

``` r
merge_data = left_join(nhanes_covar,nhanes_accel,by = "seqn")
```

- Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
  over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
  create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these
  total activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should
  compare men to women and have separate panels for each education
  level. Include a trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences.
  Comment on your plot.

``` r
merge_aggr = merge_data |> 
  group_by(seqn,sex,education,age) |> 
  summarize(total_activities = sum(mims))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'education'. You can
    ## override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
plot_total = merge_aggr |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activities, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(.~ education) +
  labs(
    x = "Age",
    y ="Total activities",
    color = "Sex"
  )
```

\*\* Comments: according to the plots, we can see that all three panels
of line smooth shows decreasing tendency of total activities, with the
increase of age. The level of more than high school education shows a
kind of stable trend with slight decrease from the age of 20 to 80 in
both men and women, however, there are obvious decreasing trends in the
education levels of high school equivalent and less than high school. To
be more specific, in the level of less than high school, women and men
have similar trend with the peak at the age of 20, and have a slight
increase between 50 and 60 years old, then suddenly drop to the bottom
level. In the level of high school equivalent, women have higher total
activities than men in general. At the age of 40, both men and women get
the highest numbers of total activities and have a significant decrease
to the lowest level at the age of 40 and 60, remaining this level at the
age of 80. In the level of more than high school education, women have a
higher total activities trend than men. There is a stable trend between
the age of 20 and 60, and slight decreasing during the age of 80.

- Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of
  the day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
  courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex.
  Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
  this graph; including smooth trends may help identify differences.

``` r
mins_plot = merge_data |> 
  group_by(minutes,education,sex) |> 
  mutate(ave_mims = mean(mims)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minutes, y = ave_mims, color = sex)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1.0) + geom_smooth(aes(group = sex))+ 
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  labs(x = "Minute of the day",
       y= "Average activity",
       color = "Sex",
       title = "24-hour activity time courses for each education level") 
```

\*\* comments: according the these three panels, we can see that they
have a quite similar trends. In this case, we know that all participants
have similar activity patterns regardless of sex and education level.
During the time between 1 min to 250 min), participants have the lowest
activity, at the minutes of 500 and 750 min, people increase the average
activities and the trends take to the peak (round 15), with the next 250
min keeping this level. Starting at 1000 min, there are significant
decreasing trends of average activities until the end of day at 15000
min. It is important to not that in the education level of more than
high school, there is a siginciant situation that women have more higher
average activities values than men during the period from 500 min to
1000 min.
